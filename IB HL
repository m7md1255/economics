<p>The demand of an individual consumer indicates the
various quantities of a good (or service) the consumer
is willing and able to buy at different possible prices
during a particular time period, ceteris paribus.</p>

<p>According to the law of demand, there is a
negative causal relationship between the price
of a good and its quantity demanded over a particular
time period, ceteris paribus: as the price of the good
increases, quantity demanded falls; as the price falls,
quantity demanded increases, ceteris paribus.</p>
